G1Pilot is an open‑source ROS 2 package for Unitree G1 humanoid robots. Basically is made to leave the robot lower body to the controller of unitree while providing all necessary tools to control the upper body and teleoperate the robot. It exposes two complementary control Joint (low‑level, per‑joint) and Cartesian (end‑effector) and continuously publishes core robot state for monitoring and visualization in RViz.

## Highlights

- Dual controller: Unitree’s built‑in loco controller for walking + custom upper‑body controller for arm manipulation.

- Dual control modes: switch between Joint and Cartesian control on the fly.

- Always‑on telemetry: IMU, odometry, and per‑motor feedback (temperature, voltage, position, velocity).

- RViz‑ready: packaged URDF + RViz config for immediate visualization of the real robot.

- Docker‑first workflow: reproducible build/run scripts for Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble.

- Extensible: clear node boundaries and parameters make it easy to add behaviors or swap planners.

- Navigation stack integrated: MOLA odometry and path planner for autonomous navigation.

## Pre-requisites
- Be connected to the robot via Ethernet. **It's important to know which interface you are using.**

## Quick Start
### Docker (recommended)
We prepare two docker images to build and run the package. One is for building in the teleoperation station, and the other is for running in the robot. Both images
are located in the `docker` folder. You can build and run the images with the provided scripts.
To build the docker image in the laptop, run the following command:
  ```bash
  sh build.sh
  ```

To build the docker image in the robot, run the following command:
  ```bash
  sh build_camera.sh
  ```

Then, you can run the docker image in the laptop with the following command:
  ```bash
  sh run.sh
  ```

To run the docker image in the robot with the following command:
  ```bash
  sh run_camera.sh
  ```

## 🧠 Nodes Overview

- **robot_state**: Publishes the state of the robot, including joint positions, velocities, and efforts and custom message to visualize the temperature and voltage of each motor.
- **interactive_marker**: Provides an interactive marker in RViz to control the end-effector position and orientation in Cartesian space.
- **dx3_controller**: Node to control the DEX3 Unitree hand, allowing to open and close the hand using ROS2 commands.
- **joystick**: Node to teleoperate the robot using a joystick, mapping joystick inputs to robot commands.
- **joy_mux**: Multiplexer for joystick inputs, allowing to switch between different control modes, specifcally made to provide autonomous navigation and teleoperation using the same joystick.
- **loco_client**: Client node to communicate with the Unitree loco controller, providing high-level commands for walking and balancing and low-level commands for joint control and cartesian control.
- **dijkstra_planner**: Custom path planner using Dijkstra's algorithm to compute optimal paths for the robot to follow in a given environment with a look ahead distance parameter to smooth the path and improve navigation performance.
- **nav2point**: Node to integrate the planner with the navigation stack, converting navigation goals into waypoints for the robot to follow.
- **create_map**: Dummy node to create a 2D occupancy grid map from the robot's sensors, used for navigation and obstacle avoidance. 
- **mola_fixed**: Node to interface with the MOLA odometry system, transform the odometry data into g1 frame.
- **arm_controller**: Node to control the upper body of the robot, providing joint and cartesian control modes for the arms.
- **ui_interface**: Node to provide a user interface to control the main functionalities of the robot.
## Usage

### Configuration File
The configuration file is located in the `config` folder. You can modify the parameters according to your needs. It's important to set up all the correct information for your robot.

### Instructions
Once you have the docker image running, you can run the following command to start the unitree node:

```bash
colcon build
```

Then, source the workspace:

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

You can launch the bringup robot with the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch g1pilot bringup_launcher.launch.py
```

Or you can run each node separately according to your needs.

1.- To run the Livox LiDAR, you can run the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch g1pilot livox_launcher.launch.py
```

2.- To run the mola odometry, you can run the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch g1pilot mola_launcher.launch.py
```

3.- To run the navigation stack and enable the locomotion of the robot, you can run the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch g1pilot navigation_launcher.launch.py
```

4.- To run the manipulation stack, you can run the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch g1pilot manipulation_launcher.launch.py
```

5.- To run the teleoperation stack, you can run the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch g1pilot teleoperation_launcher.launch.py
```

6.- You can run the depth camera on the robot with the following command:
```bash
ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py depth_module.depth_profile:=1280x720x30 pointcloud.enable:=true
```

## Common Issues
- **Network Configuration**: Ensure that your computer's network interface is correctly configured to communicate with the robot. Check IP addresses and subnet masks.
- **send request error**: Sometimes, you might encounter a "send request error" when the loco controller is not responding. For this: Go to the [g1_loco_api.py](/unitree_sdk2_python/unitree_sdk2py/g1/loco) and modify the LOCO_SERVICE_NAME to `sport` instead of `loco` and then run the command `python3 /ros2_ws/src/g1pilot/g1pilot/tools/reset_robot.py` to reset the robot. This will allow you to control the robot in a low level way and you should only do it once.
